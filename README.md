## Project Overview:
Analyze the temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to evaluate the year-round sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop business.

### Project Analytical Challange:
*After a trip to Hawaii, I have determined that I want to live on the island of Oahu forever (who doesn't). My plan is to move to Oahu and open a shop that sells surfboards and shakes.  I have some savings that can be used, but I will need some serious investor backing to make the shop a reality. I just had a great meeting with a potentional investor, who is a surfer, and loves the idea of the shop.  However, before he is ready to invest in my shop, he has some concerns about the weather there.  He wants me to perform an analysis on some Hawaiian temperature data.  Specifically, he would like an analysis for the weather in the months of June and December.*

- Right away we can see that the temperatures in December tend to be cooler than June. 
- Average temperature in December is a mild (71F) while the average temperature in June run a bit warmer (75F).
- June temperatures tend to stay constant in the range (73F - 77F) while December can have a little bit more change (69F - 74).
- December can get down to as low as 56F while the low in June can get down to 64F.

## Project Summary:

The weather on Oahu provides enough warmth for plenty of outside activities, especially at beach! The month of June looks a prime month for both surfing and cold ice cream. In fact, you could say that June might make the perfect month to have the grand opening.  Decemeber has warm weather too, but it can also have some days where it's not ideal for surfing and ice cream.  I wouldn't be too worried too much about cold weather though.  According to the data, those type of days have not been a common occurence.  Overall, a surf and shake shop on the island of Oahu seems like a match made in heaven if I do say so myself.  Although, I would order some extra cookie dough flavor before I come to visit!

### Possible additional queries

If we wanted to go further on the analysis, I would recommend looking at the amount of precipitation during the months of June and December.  This analysis could give us an idea of how much rain we can expect during those months. It can still be warm and rain!  Having an idea of how much rain we could encouner might be a big help to how we plan the activites for the shop.
