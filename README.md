# surfs_up_new

## Challenge Overview:
*I have just visted Hawaii and you determine that I want to live on Oahu forever (who doesn't). My plan is move there and open a shop that sells surfboards and shakes to the locals, tourists, and myself. I have some savings that can be used, but I will need some serious investor backing to make the shop a reality. I just had a great meeting with a potentional investor who is a surfer and loves the idea.  However, before he is ready to invest in my shop, he has some concerns about the weather he would like cleared up.  He is giving me some data and wants me to perform an analysis for temperatures in Hawaii.  Specifically, he would like analysis for the months of June and December.*
